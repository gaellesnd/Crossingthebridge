	    		HOW TO PLAY JUNGLE?</br></br>
	    		Many years ago, three missionaries and three cannibals waited to cross a river. The boat that they had could only carry two. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.</br></br>
				However the cannibals were ferociously hungry and the three missionaries were a little uneasy. In fact, it was certain that any of the missionaries would be eaten if the came to be outnumbered by the cannibals.</br></br>
				Was there any way to cross everyone over the river without losing a missionary ?</br></br>
				ITâ€™S YOUR TURN !<br/><br/>
